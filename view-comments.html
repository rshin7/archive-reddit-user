For your home page, image goes in your config file (.yaml example below)
    
    params:
      title: "Site Title"
      images:
        - https://example.com/images/image-home.png

For each blog post, add the images parameter like so:

    ---

            <p class="text-gray-600">The unit is not rent stabilized, they’re month to month, and have lived there to qualify for 90 day notice- where is the intimidation? An agent is called an agent because they represent the landlord. It seems like you’re suggesting they squat and get evicted?</p>
            
            
                
        <div class="comment bg-white p-4 border-b mb-4 rounded shadow-lg pl-6 border-l-2 border-gray-200">
            <p class="text-gray-600">Agent doesn’t own the building so I’d ignore them and reach out to the landlord. Agent is trying to intimidate you so you’ll move early and they can rent it to someone else for more money to make the deal look better. Document this and sent a certified letter to landlord that agent is threatening you and it’s interfering with your peaceful enjoyment and that you appreciate all information coming directly from landlord/management. Tell them that you are willing to sign a lease and give them a number that you are comfortable with that’s more than what you are paying. If they refuse and stick with the $1500 increase try to get them to pay you to leave. 

They can’t make you leave, they can evict you but that’s not going to look good to prospective buyers and will take a long time.</p>

It sounds like your goal is to create a list of files in a directory. Look into: https://gohugo.io/templates/lists/ and https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/list-files-in-a-directory/21258/3</p>

            <p class="text-gray-600">Thank you. 

Can I specify the type of Twitter card to use, or will it always be a large summary card?</p>
